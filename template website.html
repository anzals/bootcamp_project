    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Catch</h3>
    <p>
My project illustrates understanding of loops, classes and if statements. I created a class "ball" and placed multiple functions within it, including draw and move. I used an array list to contain all the miniature balls and used random variables to determine the sizes and colours of the balls. I also used the ball class to create the characteristics of the infected ball. If statements were placed to keep the miniature balls within the canvas and the infected ball the ability to loop around the canvas. The stage variables created different screens, a home screen and level one, with this feature I am able to create multiple extra levels if needed. The infected ball is controlled by the key pressed function, with the keys 'w'(up), 's'(down), 'a'(left), and 'd'(right). The small balls move in random directions and are bounced off the edges of the canvas with an if loop timesing the velocity by -1. A boolean was used so that when all the small balls had the infected colour then the game was completed. Finally, an if loop is used to ensure that when the timer has reached 30 seconds the game ends and the player has failed the level.
